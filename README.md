#Monte Carlo Method


In MATH1402 file, there a simulation on Ant's movement. Suppose there's a triangle, there's also an ant on the triangle. Suppose we want to know the approximate probability of the ant leaving at the longest side, hence We use Monte Carlo Approach to do it.

<h4>Pro</h4>
1. Flexible <br>
2. Easy to Understood <br>
3. Simple to make <br>

<h4>Con</h4>
1. High computational complexity<br>
2. May need Super-computer to do heavy calculations<br>
3. Accuracy is directly proportional to iterations<br>

I like Physics very much, once upon a time I wanted to pursue it as a profession but unfortunately things didn't work out the way I wish, but it doesn't mean that I have given this up. I read Physics and Biology during my free time. I recommend <a href="http://www.fizika.unios.hr/rf/wp-content/uploads/sites/67/2011/02/CPwP.pdf">this</a>, It's a book on Computation physics, It's fun to read, easy to understand...

<h4> History of Monte Carlo </h4>
The modern form of Monte Carlo dates back the 1940s when the following scientists Enrico
Fermi (Physicist), Stanislaw Ulam (Mathematician) and John Von Neumann whilst working Los
Alamos Scientific Laboratory which was part of the Manhattan Project.<br>
Fermi in the 1930s had done work regarding Monte Carlo as way of approximation but it was a
highly rigorous and time consuming and failed to gain traction. In the 1940s when he met with
John Von Neumann the combination of Fermi’s approximation method and Von Neumann’s
computer knowledge where able to use it calculate approximations with high degree of accuracy.
In modern finance it is used as financial concepts have got more complicated to be able to
approximate accurate financial scenarios.
